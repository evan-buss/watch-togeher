Bugs:
    ☐  An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.
        System.InvalidOperationException: The SPA default page middleware could not return the default page '/index.html' because it was not found, and no other middleware handled the request.
        - Not sure when this occurs, but it seems to only be in the production build
    ☐ Scan button should stop loading indicator on error
    ☐ Make library connection error message better
    ☐ Chat sidebar expands once a long message is sent. It has a limit, but it should be at the limit immediately

Design:
    Figure out how clients are going to connect.
    ☐ Remove the IP address field as the user's will need to direct connect.
    ☐ The host should be given or set a password so that other users cannot control the media.
    ☐ Think of a better way to play the movie. Current UX is kind wonky
    
Web Scraper / Metadata API:
    ☐ Work on the rewrite of the web scraper in C#
    ☐ Use a postgresql database instead of an SQLITE 3 database
        - Do all the scraping locally, and then create a dump that will be uploaded.
