Bugs:
    ☐  An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.
        System.InvalidOperationException: The SPA default page middleware could not return the default page '/index.html' because it was not found, and no other middleware handled the request.
        - Not sure when this occurs, but it seems to only be in the production build
    ☐ Scan button should stop loading indicator on error
    ☐ Make library connection error message better
    ☐ Chat sidebar expands once a long message is sent. It has a limit, but it should be at the limit immediately

Design:
    Figure out how clients are going to connect.
    ☐ Remove the IP address field as the user's will need to direct connect.
    ☐ The host should be given or set a password so that other users cannot control the media.
        ☐ Come up witha randomly generated word-pair password. The host enters this password to confirm their identity
    ✔ Think of a better way to play the movie. Current UX is kind wonky @done(19-12-07 23:14)
    ☐ Figure out a way to keep the variable length text from overflowing on movie cards...
Web Scraper / Metadata API:
    ☐ Work on the rewrite of the web scraper in C#
    ✔ Use a postgresql database instead of an SQLITE 3 database @done(19-12-07 23:15)
        - Do all the scraping locally, and then create a dump that will be uploaded.
    ☐ Get the app back in working order
        ✔ Metadata search doesn't work, we need to decide if we are using offset or just sending all results and letting frontend paginate manually; @done(19-12-07 23:05)
        ✔ Decide how metadata API and scraper will be structured in git (need another repository) @done(19-12-07 23:22)
        ☐ Figure out how the metadata api will be hosted. Fucking heroku with a 10k row limit...
        ☐ Create single docker-compose script to run the database and the API
        ☐ Create a specific docker "network" for the api and database to share... Might have to transfer existing data
