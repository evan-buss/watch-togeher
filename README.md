# watch-together...2

- Angular / .NET Core rewrite of watch-together.

## 2?
- I am porting the parts I have written to the new stack.
- The previous implementation was far from finished, mainly just UI
- Wanted to switch to a more robust and enterprise level stack.
  - I felt that Golang was too "loosey-goosey" as there are not really any established architecture best practices
  - Svelte is very young and immature. They don't even have a router package yet...
- I don't regret the time I put in to the original as I learned a lot about video streaming, Golang, and Svelte along the way.
